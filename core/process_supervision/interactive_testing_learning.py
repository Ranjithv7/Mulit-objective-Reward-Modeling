# 📚 LEARNING EXERCISES (Try these!)
# ============================================================================

"""
🎯 TRY THESE EXERCISES TO DEEPEN YOUR UNDERSTANDING:

1. CUSTOM PROBLEM:
   - Create your own multi-step problem 
   - Define step correctness and importance
   - Run through all 4 analysis methods
   
2. STRATEGY COMPARISON:
   - Try different stepwise assignment strategies
   - Compare which gives most intuitive results
   - When would each strategy be best?

3. PARAMETER TUNING:
   - Change decay_factor in temporal credit assignment
   - See how it affects credit distribution
   - What value works best for your problem?

4. COUNTERFACTUAL SCENARIOS:
   - Design a problem where removing step 1 breaks everything
   - Create a case where all steps are equally necessary
   - Build a scenario with one super-sufficient step

5. INTEGRATION EXPERIMENT:
   - Use real reasoning problems (math, coding, etc.)
   - See if the analysis matches your intuition
   - Find cases where the model disagrees with you

🔥 REMEMBER: This is how systems like GPT-4, Claude, and advanced 
reasoning models understand and improve their step-by-step thinking!
